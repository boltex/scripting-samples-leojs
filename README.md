# ![LeoEditor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boltex/leojs/master/resources/leoapp.png) Scripting Samples for LeoJS

[LeoJS](https://github.com/boltex/leojs?tab=readme-ov-file#-literate-editor-with-outline) can run Leo scripts in both JavaScript or TypeScript, instead of Python.

Three predefined symbols, c, g, and p give Leo scripts easy access to all the data in the outline. These symbols also allow Leo scripts to execute any code in Leo‚Äôs own codebase. The g symbols also contains references to useful objects, such as the VSCode API, to handle interactions with the UI, other extensions, or anything else in the IDE.

## This repository contains a Leo file which demonstrates various ways to use the VSCode API and interact with its UI.

[Install the LeoJS extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_browse-for-extensions), right-click on the **scripting-sample.leojs** file in the explorer to open it with LeoJS, and see the **Introduction** node for more details on each sample script.

Don't hesitate to ask questions, file issues, or make comments and suggestions on [the project's issue page](https://github.com/boltex/leojs/issues).

### Enjoy! ü¶Å
